This game was created using canvas as an opportunity to understand the basic principles and practice javascript. The repo can be accessed on [Github](https://github.com/Iamshola/wdi-fundamentals-memorygame) and the deployed site can be viewed on [Gh-Pages](https://iamshola.github.io/wdi-fundamentals-memorygame/).

This is a game I made as part of the General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive on boarding process.

### Languages and Technologies Used:

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. GitHub

### Review
This was a challenge trying to use all the fundamentals I had learnt from JavaScript to make my first game! I would have to loved to improve this game by adding a score board. In the future, I would display all the correct cards after they had been selected and stop them from flipping back!
